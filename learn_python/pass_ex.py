'''
 Why we use 'pass':
 - It is a placeholder.
 - It allows us to write syntactically correct code, even when we are not ready to define the behavior yet.
 - It can be used to avoid errors in empty function definitions, loops, or conditionals.
 - It helps us plan and organize our code structure, while leaving some parts to be filled in later.
